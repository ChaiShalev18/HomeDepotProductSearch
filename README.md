# Home Depot Product Search Relevance

This project, a collaborative effort by @livneido1, @eladinbar, and @ChaiShalev18, aims to improve the search relevance of Home Depot's product search engine using machine learning techniques, specifically PyTorch. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the relevance of search queries to product listings, thereby enhancing the overall search experience for users.

## Competition Details

This project is based on the Home Depot Product Search Relevance competition on Kaggle. The competition involves predicting the relevance of search queries to product listings based on provided training data, which includes search queries, product titles, and relevance scores.

## Features

- Utilizes PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, for building the relevance model.
- Implements advanced NLP techniques such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and attention mechanisms.
- Handles data preprocessing tasks such as text normalization, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- Includes data visualization and analysis to gain insights into the provided training data.
- Performs model training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- Evaluates model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and interprets the results.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Utilizes PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and other Python libraries for deep learning and data manipulation tasks.
- Data preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw text data into suitable formats for model training.
- Deep learning: Builds and trains neural networks using PyTorch for relevance prediction.
- Model evaluation: Utilizes appropriate evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for performance assessment.
